Johnny Bardo is a musical solo project and alter ego of Louis Franck, a Swiss singer, songwriter, and composer. The project emerged after Franck's return from a trip to India and is characterized by its emotionally positive and creatively free expression. The debut album, Basket Case, released in 2009, showcases a blend of alternative rock and lyrical depth, described as "an album of light joy." Louis Franck is also known for his work with the rock band Esthetic Education and for composing music for films such as Marfa (2004) and Under Electric Clouds (2015).
