Filmed with 25-cameras this interactive app allows you to explore the world of orchestral music.

★★★★★ "The ORCHESTRA app offers an overture to listening to an orchestra like no other. Follow the instrumental notation as you hear instrumentalists appear, and see how they navigate every crescendo and diminuendo. Help yourself distinguish the oboe from clarinet and bassoon, and marvel at the foundations the violins often play. You will come to appreciate each composer's artistry and marvel at his / her orchestrations in ways mere listening doesn't allow. This app is moves Musical Appreciation to a new level. I highly recommend it"
