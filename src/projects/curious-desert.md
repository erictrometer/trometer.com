The film explores Olafur Eliasson's extensive exhibition titled "The curious desert". It is a two-part exhibition, consisting of site-specific installations in the sabka near the Al Thakhira Mangrove in Northern Qatar, and an extensive gallery presentation at the National Museum of Qatar. The film looks at Olafur's experimentation with light and color, geometric studies, ecological awareness, and the exploration of more-than-human relationships.
