The soldier is a feature documentary predominantly set in the slums of Katwe in Kampala – Uganda. It follows four children and their mentor Richard Walusimbi, a selfless 37-year-old mentor who grew up on the streets. Richard developed an unorthodox way to use acrobatics as a tool to teach resilience and give deprived and abandoned children the skills necessary to turn their life around and build a future for themselves.
