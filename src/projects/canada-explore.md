**Brief:** Destination Canada approached TCO to shift its marketing strategy to centre on content through a video influencer campaign that would resonate with the YouTube generation without leaving its Gen X and Babyboomer audience behind. Victor Mercier (finalist of the 2018 edition of Top Chef France) goes on a journey to meet farmers, chefs, and winemakers—as well as members of Ontario's First Nations—who all share his passion for food security. Bring it to life!

**Approach:** Use fast paced edits with fly-on-wall documentary techniques to encapsulate a sense of journey and drive the story forward.

**Result:** 3.5M+ views on YouTube alone a top performer on their channel.
