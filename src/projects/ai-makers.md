**Brief:** We shot some footage and would love to make 3 films to show the people behind AI. It's tight deadline.

**Approach:** Use simple on-screen boxes similar to the Thomas Crown Affair. Why? It mimicks the AI box packing system – which two of the films are about. So why not? 🙂

**Result:** Three films that bring the audience closer to the people behind AI.
