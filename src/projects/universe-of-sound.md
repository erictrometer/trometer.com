The Philharmonia's largest installation, Universe of Sound, transformed a performance of Holst's The Planets into a ten-room exhibition than filled an entire building or gallery space. The piece was captured with 37 video cameras and 40+ multi-track audio.

Visitors walk through each different section of the Orchestra at their own pace, and set their own route. They choose to walk continually throughout the exhibition, or stay seated in one section for as long as they wish. The exhibition is interactive, allowing visitors to conduct the Orchestra, following the hand movements of conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, and play along with our percusisonists.

Universe of Sound, and its predecessor exhibition, RE-RITE, based on Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, toured internationally and were experienced by over 300,000 people.
