**Brief:** Produce a captivating promo that encapsulates what the brand stands for. The result is to be used across social media and PR channels, as well as the COP16 UN biodiversity talks as 196 nations and pharma industry leaders meet in Cali, Colombia.

**Approach:** Use previously shot archive as well as animations, to deliver a coherent but slightly different message in 2 versions:
- one that focuses solely on the USP;
- another that also weaves in the investment journey so far;

**Result:** Two dynamic and punchy 30-sec videos delivered in 16:9 + 9:16 + 1:1
